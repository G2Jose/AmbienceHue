### How to use
#### Requirements
- Mac with Xcode & command line tools installed

- Quartz.CoreGraphics python module

	```bash
	pip install -U pyobjc-core
	pip install -U pyobjc
	```

- PHue python module

	```bash
	pip install phue
	```

- AmbienceHue code

	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:G2Jose/AmbienceHue.git
	```

#### Customizing
- Change the value of `BRIDGE_IP` to the IP address of your Hue Bridge. You can find this by logging into your Router's admin page. 
- Change the `LEFT_LIGHT` and `RIGHT_LIGHT` parameters to match your setup. This might require some trial to figure out what numbers map to what lights. 
- The transition time is set to 0.1 ds (0.1 * 1/10th of a second) to avoid the appearance of the lights flickering. 
- By default, the script only watches a strip 1/20th the width of the screen on each side. This setting can be changed by modifying the `WIDTH` parameter.
- By default, the script only watches 1 every 50 pixels along the width, and one every 100 pixels along the length of this area. This can be changed by modifying the `COL_INTERVAL` & `ROW_INTERVAL` parameters. Sampling more pixels will have an impact on the refresh rate of the lightbulbs. 

#### Launching
- Navigate to the directory containing the script

	```bash
	cd AmbienceHue
	```

- Launch the script using python (tested on 2.7)

	```bash
	python AmbienceHue.py
	```
